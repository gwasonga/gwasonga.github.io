	<li><b>THE CHURCH ELDERS</b></li>
	<div class="content clearfix">
	<p>God calls every member of the church into ministry. The church is a kingdom of priests <br>
	set free to minister for Christ. Our priesthood is to each other within the church and to the world.<br>
	An elder, like any other church officer, is a ministering servant of God. Every Christian believer <br>
	is called to ministry, gifted by the Holy Spirit, and in baptism ordained for ministry (Eph. 4:11-12).</p>
	
	<p><strong>Duties of the Elder:</strong></p>
<p>The ministry to which a person is called when he becomes an elder can best be described in the following ways:</p>
<ol style="padding-left: 24px">
<li style="margin-top:6px"><strong> Visitation. </strong> The elder will be responsible for the spiritual nurture and care of those members in his parish. He will visit members in their homes for prayer and encouragement. He will also assist in giving Bible studies to prospective members.</li>
<li style="margin-top:6px"><strong>Worship services</strong>. The elder will lead the worship service as scheduled. He will review the order of service ahead of time to insure that all responsible parties are prepared and ready to serve.</li>
<li style="margin-top:6px"><strong> Preaching</strong>. The elder may be asked to preach when the pastor is out-of-town or not available.</li>
<li style="margin-top:6px"><strong> A Spiritual Mentor</strong>. The spiritual life of an elder should constantly lead members of the church to seek a deeper spiritual experience for themselves. I Timothy, chapter 3, describes the Christian life of an elder in these words: “. . . 
									above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle. . .
									” An elder should model, by his or her devotional life, Christian personality and spiritual interest, a higher ideal for each member to reach. The elder should reflect the fruits of the Spirit in his or her relationship with others: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.</li>
<li style="margin-top:6px"><strong> Church Administration</strong>. An elder should always attempt to make a positive contribution to the organization and progress of the church. While doing this, he or she should not try to dominate or control but rather enable others to participate in decision-making in the church and ministry. 
									An elder often serves in an advisory capacity to various departments, committees, and projects.</li>
<ul style="padding-left: 18px">
<li>An elder is a member of the church board and attends on a regular basis in order to provide input and counsel regarding church issues.</li>
<li>The board of elders will meet together with the pastor once per month for visioning, administration, prayer, and counsel. This is typically on the Sunday morning before the scheduled board meeting.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><strong>Appropriate Spiritual Gifts:</strong></p>
<ul style="padding-left: 18px">
<li style="margin-top:6px"><strong>Exhortation</strong> &#8211; The special ability God gives some to bring encouragement and comfort to others.</li>
<li style="margin-top:6px"><strong>Pastor/Shepherd</strong> &#8211; The ability to carry a personal responsibility for the spiritual welfare of a group of believers and act as a shepherd, overseer, protector, and guide to the church.</li>
<li style="margin-top:6px"><strong>Administration</strong> &#8211; The ability to guide the church in meeting it’s goals.</li>
<li style="margin-top:6px"><strong>Leadership</strong> &#8211; The ability to help others set goals and communicate these goals to others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Commitment</strong>:<br />
Including Sabbath duty, most elders will need to plan on two to four hours per week to carry out their duties.</p>

		<ul type="disc">
			<li>Assistance at Services and Meetings</li>

	<p text-align="justify">
		Music ministry at Kimoro Seventh-day Adventist Church is focused on serving, rather than performing. <br>
		All the music made is meant to bring both the musicians and congregation closer to God. <br>
		It is an important piece to the order of the worship service. At Kimoro SDA, we love to praise and worship Jesus Christ.<br>
		There are several groups that help to make the music department an evangelistic tool in the goal of reaching souls. <br><br> 
		We enjoy singing every Sabbath, because as a church family we understand that we must continue to use our talents and gifts for Christ. <br>
		The music department’s goal is always to win at least one soul for Christ whenever we are called to serve in music.

<div class="children">
	<li><b>THE CHILDREN MINISTRY</b></li>
	<p><b><i>Our Core Beliefs:</i></b><br><br>
			Children are gifts from God. (Psalm 127:3-5 & Luke 17:2) Children, like all the rest of humanity, are seriously flawed and need a savior.<br>
			(Genesis 8:21 & Psalm 51:5) Children can grow in grace & use their spiritual gifts for the glory of God. (1 Peter 3:18)<br><br>
			Our desire is to reach children for Jesus Christ through quality, age appropriate interaction and creative activities designed<br>
			to build a strong spiritual foundation in the life of each child. We love our children, present the gospel, disciple, believers<br>
			toward spiritual maturity, and partner with parents as well as encourage every family to make a whole life commitment to our Savior,<br> Jesus Christ.<br><br>

<div class="stewardship-min">
	<li><b>THE STEWARDSHIP MINISTRY</b></li>
	<div class="content clearfix">		
<h4>Stewardship is ALL of me in response to ALL of God. [Matt 22:37-39]</h4>
<p>Stewardship starts with God as the Creator Owner of the Universe who made Adam and Eve after His own image. With His personal touch, God established an intimate relationship and union with humanity that was to be nurtured in the intimacy of time spent together. This shared image[1] and shared intimacy [2] are foundational to understanding the spirit and dynamics of biblical stewardship.</p>
<p>God established Adam and Eve as rulers over the earth (Gen. 1:26-28). Through this act, God made them His partners over creation — placing the entire world as their trust in shared governance[3] with Him. It was in Eden that humanity first became stewards, and acted as God’s agents on earth. In this sense, God established a relationship of interdependence[4] with humanity. The awesome concept of God’s dependence upon humanity is crucial to our accepting full dependence upon Him.</p>
<p>When sin entered the world, it shattered and distorted God’s creation and separated humankind from God. The union with the Creator was broken, the image of God was marred, the shared governance was surrendered, and this earth became sin’s domain.</p>
<p>In Jesus Christ, God restored this divine-human relationship and re-established His kingdom on earth. Thus the gospel provides reconciliation between God and humanity as Christ became the second Adam, winning back humanity’s lost stewardship. Today, stewardship begins with the recognition of God’s sovereignty as Creator, Redeemer, Sustainer and Owner.</p>
<p>Through the incarnation, Christ identified Himself fully with humanity. The shared intimacy of God with humankind is embodied in Jesus Christ—the God-man. &nbsp;His life and death form the basis of a renewed relationship with God. Through the ministry of the Holy Spirit, the living presence of Jesus restores the reality of a shared intimacy between God and us.</p>
<p>As the model steward, Jesus Christ demonstrated the lifestyle of the individual in union with God. Through His ministry in heaven, Christ enthrones humanity with Him, (Eph. 2:6) and renews humanity’s partnership with God. In this partnership, the human agent functions as regent under the authority of God. When allowed to live on the throne of one’s life, God lifts the believer to sit with Him on His throne. All the power of heaven is available to aid God’s stewards in their daily living.</p>
<p>Restoring the image of God in humanity is part of the redemption process. While not complete before the Second Coming, the process begins here on earth. The Holy Spirit brings the promised presence of Christ into the life of the believer (John 14:16-20), and begins a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). Sinful humanity, saved by grace, once again shares the image of God (2 Pet. 1:4). Through the power of the living Christ, the believer who accepts this divine gift is once again in complete union with God.</p>

	<li><b>THE SABBATH SCHOOL DEPARTMINT</b></li>
	<div class="content clearfix">
<p>In 1853, only a few years after the first group of Sabbath-keeping Adventists was formed in Washington, New Hampshire, James White organized the first regular Sabbath School in Rochester, New York. 
In 1852, estimating an informal membership of about 1,000 in the state of New York, White had written a series of 19 lessons appearing in the new Youth’s Instructor.
<img style="float: right;" src="gallery/sspmin_logo.png" alt="sabbath school  personal min logo" width="272" height="260" /></p>
<p>From its inception Sabbath School has focused on four emphases that are still prominent to this day: fellowship development, community outreach, Bible study, and foreign mission. A solid balance of these elements characterizes the most vital Sabbath Schools around the world.</p>
<p>Based on these four emphases, from its beginning in 1853, Sabbath School membership has exploded from a handful of believers in upstate New York to an estimated 14 million today. Former General Conference President Jan Paulsen has said that Sabbath School is like breakfast. 
For more than 150 years it has provided the spiritual nourishment that is needed to meet the challenges that arise during the rest of the week.
