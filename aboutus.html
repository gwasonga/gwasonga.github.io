<h1><u><i>Background information</u></i></h1>
<p>Seventh-day Adventist Christians do not take lightly the instruction in Hebrews 10:25: "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching". That was the spirit of Adventist believers who worked in proximity to one another and having a desire to have an English speaking Church in the third largest city in Kenya, Kisumu, who sequentially organized a company for fellowship and worship with the aim of having a church.</p>
<h2><u><i>History of Kimoro SDA Church</i></u></h2>
	<p><BLINK>The history of our Church will be updated soon</BLINK></p>
<h2><u><i>Founders of Kimoro SDA Church</i></u></h2>
<p>The history of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church Kimoro, Suba did not precisely fall into this general category of organized 
companies. The foregoing historical sketch amplifies their peculiarity. 
</div>

<div class="WordSection2" align="center"><br><br>
<h1><u><i>The birth of Kimoro SDA Church</i></u></h1>
<p>Hard work and prayer spearheaded by Sis. Jane Owiti and Pastor Mireri Okeyo, the then GodBura District Pastor, 
yielded the approval for use of the grass thatched hall as a church 21/7/1989. 
<h2><u><i>Church construction</i></u></h3>
<p>After 5 years, a public utility, disruptions were the order of the day as anybody can book and use the hall irrespective of the day. The quest for a Church plot ensued to shed the uncertainties that became associated with our worship. Efforts by our founding members together with the then District Leader, Pastor Yambo bore fruits. A plot was found at the locality and arrangements were made to secure the same. The plot did not come forth smoothly as returns were little and the devil ensured that seeds of discord were planted including words that the Church was duped to buy land that never existed to ensure that members were divided. With the support of the families of Kenyanyas’, Magekas’, Omwansas’, Dr. Daniel Mokayas’, and the Onukos together with Pastor Yambo and the elders, the Church plot was secured with the signing of a purchase agreement between the church and the seller.</p>
</div>
<p>In a dramatic turn of events, and as a confirmation that God’s time was the best, the Holy Spirit led the members in the construction of the structure which is currently in use. The members had been requested to look for an alternative place within the municipal hall for use during the week of revival as the hall was booked. The only place available then was an open space near the road and luck was not on our side as we were disrupted by a heavy down pour. Colleagues from the Government challenged the church to put up a structure considering the potential of the members. Inspiration from Elder. Eliazar Mibina and Elder. Salmon Otego, the then development chairman and support from the members led by the spirit were focused towards having their worship place. Brother Joel Owino took the challenge further by taking the responsibility of being the ‘construction engineer.’ The construction of the Church was approved under Church Business Min10/4/1991 and construction begun on 11/4/1991. Within one month, a wonderful Church structure was in place and the children of God had a shelter to worship.</p>
<p>The Church has undergone tremendous support and Christian leadership of several individuals and groups. Over the course of our existence, our modus operandus has been "all-hands-on-deck ". Everyone in Kimoro SDA Church is loving, busy and ready for challenges if given. Our lunch time sumptuous Sabbath fellowship meals are a regular feature.</p>
<p>Our church is located at the Kimoro Village, behind Kimoro Primary School, about 500 meters from the junction and the church signpost is visible. The first strategic plan 2009-2013 of church was spearheaded by Elder. Wilfred Agenyo. As we celebrate our history and officially inaugurate our second the strategic plan, our prayer is threefold; that the Lord should: 1) continue to use us to spread the good news of Jesus Christ, 2) extend our territory, and 3) send others out to help.</p>
<p>Glory be to God. AMEN.</p>
